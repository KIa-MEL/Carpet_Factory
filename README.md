<h1>Carpet Factory</h1>


A carpet weaving factory needs a system to manage and mechanize factory work. This system includes various departments such as design, sales, distribution, etc.
Each part of this system is explained separately.
  
<h2>Design</h2>
The factory plans to introduce new carpets to the market, so it wants to design new plans. They plan to weave carpets that are made of shapes
are formed geometrically and these geometric shapes are adjacent to each other. Each of these geometric shapes is the same color. The number of colors used
The cost of the woven carpet is lower if it is less for the weave of the carpet. For this reason, the factory wants the least number of colors by receiving information from the carpet areas

</br>
</br>

__ðŸŸ£ Using the graph coloring algorithm, the required number of colors has been obtained.__
  
<h2>Shopping</h2>
  
+ <h3>Search by carpet layout :</h3>
    In this part of the system, by receiving a matrix that can be a map of a carpet, based on the percentage of similarity between the carpets in the system, it       selects carpets for the user.
    suggests In other words, it sorts the carpets based on their similarity to the input carpet map (find the three most similar carpet maps). Note
    All factory carpet maps are assumed to be 300 x 400 matrices.
  
    __ðŸŸ£ To implement this section, the sequence alignment algorithm and quick sorting have been used.__

+ <h3>Purchase based on amount of money :</h3>
    In this system, the user can find the maximum number of carpets he can buy by entering the maximum amount of money he has.
  
    __ðŸŸ£ This problem is implemented by taking the idea of the backpack algorithm.__
  
+ <h3>Navigation to the nearest factory store :</h3>
    Since the factory has many branches, this system has a section where the user can find the nearest branch by entering his coordinates.
    Find the way to that point. Our hypothetical city consists of intersections that are connected to each other. These points along with the streets between them     are already introduced to the system.
  
    __ðŸŸ£ By using Digestra algorithm, the shortest path between different points is obtained.__
